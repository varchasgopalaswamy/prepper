The following properties are added:

*    density, density_units (|g/cm^3|)
        Densities for solids and liquids are given as specific
        gravities at 20\ |deg| C unless other wise indicated by
        *density_caveat*. Densities for gaseous elements
        are given for the liquids at their boiling points.
        Missing data are represented by *None*.
*   density_caveat
        Comments on the density, if not taken in standard conditions.
*   interatomic_distance, interatomic_distance_units (|Ang|)
        Interatomic distance estimated from element density.
*   number_density, number_density_units (|1/cm^3|)
        Number density estimated from mass and density.

Density for the isotope is computed assuming that the atomic spacing
is the same as that for the element in the natural abundance.

.. doctest::

    >>> from periodictable import D, H
    >>> print("H: %.4f, D: %.4f"%(H.density, D.density))
    H: 0.0708, D: 0.1415
    >>> print((D.density/H.density) / (D.mass/H.mass))
    1.0

The following plot shows density for all elements:

    Element density for natural abundance. For isotopes, return

    Estimated interatomic distance from atomic weight and density. The
    distance between isotopes is assumed to match that between atoms in
    the natural abundance.

            The element whose interatomic distance is to be calculated.

            Estimated interatomic distance.

    Interatomic distance is computed using:
