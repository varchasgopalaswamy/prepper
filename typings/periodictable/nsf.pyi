Neutron scattering factors for the elements and isotopes.

For details of neutron scattering factor values, see :class:`Neutron`.
The property is set to *None* if there is no neutron scattering information
for the element. Individual isotopes may have their own scattering
information.

The neutron scattering information table is reproduced from the Atomic
Institute for Austrian Universities\ [#Rauch2003]_  (retrieve March 2008):

http://www.ati.ac.at/~neutropt/scattering/table.html

The above site has references to the published values for every entry in
the table.  We have included these in the documentation directory
associated with the periodictable package.

.. Note:

   Enteries in the table have been measured independently, so the values
   measured for the scattering length of an element or isotope may be
   inconsistent with the values measured for the corresponding cross section.

class Neutron:
    r"""
    Neutron scattering factors are attached to each element in the periodic
    table for which values are available.  If no information is available,
    then the neutron field of the element will be *None*. Even when neutron
    information is available, it may not be complete, so individual fields
    may be *None*.

    The following fields are defined:

    * b_c (fm)
        Bounds coherent scattering length.

    * total (barn)
        Total scattering cross section $\sigma_s$.  This does not include the
        absorption cross section.  To compute the total collision cross
        section use $\sigma_t = \sigma_s + \sigma_a$

    * absorption (barn)
        Absorption cross section $\sigma_a$ at 1.798 |Ang|.  Scale to your beam
        by dividing by periodictable.nsf.ABSORPTION_WAVELENGTH and multiplying
        by your wavelength.

    * b_c_complex (fm)
        Complex coherent scattering length derived from the tabulated
        values using $b_c - i \sigma_a / (1000 \cdot 2 \lambda)$.

    Additional columns not used for calculation include:

    * b_c_i (fm)
        Imaginary bound coherent scattering length.  This is related to
        absorption cross section by $\sigma_a = 4 \pi \mathrm{Im}(b_c)/k$ where
        $k = 2 \pi/\lambda$ and an additional factor of 1000 for converting
        between |Ang|\ |cdot|\ fm and barns.  b_c_i is not available for
        all isotopes for which absorption cross sections have been measured.

    * bp, bm (fm)
        Spin-dependent scattering for I+1/2 and I-1/2 (not always available).
        Incoherent scattering arises from the spin-dependent scattering b+
        and b-. The Neutron Data Booklet\ [#Rauch2003]_ gives formulas for
        calculating coherent and incoherent scattering from b+ and b- alone.

    * bp_i, bm_i (fm)
        Imaginary portion of bp and bm.

    * is_energy_dependent (boolean)
        Do not use this data if scattering is energy dependent.

    * coherent (barn)
        Coherent scattering cross section.  This is tabulated but not used.
        In theory coherent scattering is related to bound coherent scattering
        by $\sigma_c = 4 \pi |\mathrm{Re}(b_c) + i \mathrm{Im}(b_c)|^2/100$.
        In practice, these values are different, with the following table
        showing the largest relative difference:

        ========  ========  ========  ========  ========
        Sc   3%   Ti   4%   V   34%   Mn   1%   Cd  2%
        Te   4%   Xe   9%   Sm  19%   Eu  44%   Tb  1%
        Ho  11%   W    4%   Au   7%   Hg   2%   Ra  3%
        ========  ========  ========  ========  ========

    * incoherent (barn)
        Incoherent scattering cross section $\sigma_i$.  This is tabulated but
        not used. Instead, the incoherent cross section is computed from the
        total cross section minus the coherent cross section even for single
        atoms so that results from compounds are consistent with results from
        single atoms.

    For elements, the scattering cross-sections are based on the natural
    abundance of the individual isotopes. Individual isotopes may have
    the following additional fields

    * abundance (%)
        Isotope abundance used to compute the properties of the element in
        natural abundance.

    * nuclear_spin (string)
        Spin on the nucleus: '0', '1/2', '3/2', etc.

    Each field ``T`` above has a corresponding ``T_units`` attribute with
    the name of the units.

    For scattering calculations the scattering length density is the value
    of interest. This is computed from the *number_density* of the individual
    elements, as derived from the element density and atomic mass.

    Neutron scattering cross sections for materials are calculated from
    tabulated values for the different nuclei. The result is only an
    approximation. Actual scattering depends on details of sample composition,
    as well as the incoming neutron energy and sample temperature, especially
    for light elements. For low energy neutrons the tabulated
    cross sections are generally a lower limit. The measured incoherent
    scattering from hydrogen, for example, can be considerably larger
    (by more than 20%) than its bound value, leading to an estimate of 5.621/cm
    for H2O as computed compared to ~7.0/cm as measured with 5 meV neutrons
    at 290K.\ [#May1982]_ The alignment of the neutron spin with the nuclei
    spin also matters, as demonstrated by $^3\mathrm{He}$ polarizers.

    The tables themselves are not self-consistent.  Because the different
    quantities are measured indirectly with a variety of techniques, there
    are discrepencies when converting values from one column to another. These
    differences can be seen with the following:

        :func:`absorption_comparison_table`

        :func:`coherent_comparison_table`

        :func:`total_comparison_table`

    For our calculations we use the real part of the bound coherent scattering
    length $\mathrm{Re}(b_c)$ (labelled b_c in the tables) and the absorption
    cross section $\sigma_a$ from which we derive the imaginary scattering
    length, $\mathrm{Im}(b_c)$. See Sears (1992) for details.\ [#Sears1992]_

    We first need to average quantities for the unit cell of the molecule.
    Molar mass *m* (g/mol) is the sum of the masses of each component:

    .. math::

        m = \sum{n_k m_k}\ {\rm for\ each\ atom}\ k=1,2,\ldots

    Cell volume $V$ (|Ang^3|/molecule) is molar mass $m$ over density
    $\rho$, with a correction based on Avogadro's number $N_A$ (atoms/mol)
    and the length conversion $10^8$ |Ang|/cm:

    .. math::

        V = m/\rho \cdot 1/N_A \cdot (10^8)^3

    Number density $N$ is the number of scatterers per unit volume:

    .. math::

        N = \left.\sum{n_k} \right/ V

    The coherent scattering length of the molecule is computed from the
    average scattering length $b_c = \mathrm{Re}(b_c) + i \mathrm{Im}(b_c)$
    weighted by frequency:

    .. math::

        \mathrm{Re}(b_c) &= \left.\sum n_k \mathrm{Re}(b_{ck}) \right/ \sum n_k \\
        \mathrm{Im}(b_c) &= \left.\sum n_k \mathrm{Im}(b_{ck}) \right/ \sum n_k

    The individual $\mathrm{Im}(b_{ck})$ values are derived from the absorption
    cross sections $\sigma_a$, tabulated at wavelength $\lambda = 1.798$ |Ang|
    and scaled to fm (with 1000 fm = 1 barn/|Ang|):

    .. math::

        \mathrm{Im}(b_{ck}) = -\left. \sigma_{ak} \right/ (1000 \cdot 2 \lambda)

    Note the sign change relative to $b''$ in Sears (1992), with Eq 2
    defining $b = b' - i b''$. Since we are not considering polarized
    nuclei, the imaginary incoherent contribution is zero and
    $b'' = -\mathrm{Im}(b_c)$.

    Some rare earth isotopes are energy-dependent with complex bound coherent
    scattering length $b_c$ tabulated by energy.\ [#Lynn1990]_ For the given
    input wavelength $\lambda$, $b_c$ is interpolated from the table values,
    with the end points used for values outside the tabulated range.

    The average scattering length is converted to scattering cross
    sections, with $\sigma_c$ scaled to barn (with 1 barn= 100 |fm^2|)
    and $\sigma_a$ scaled to barn (with 1000 barn = 1 fm |Ang|):

    .. math::

        \sigma_c &= \left. 4 \pi |\mathrm{Re}(b_c) + i \mathrm{Im}(b_c)|^2 \right/ 100 \\
        \sigma_a &= -\left. 1000 \cdot 4 \pi \left< \mathrm{Im}(b_c) \right> \right/k
            \ {\rm for} \ k=2\pi / \lambda

    For most elements the scattering length is independent of energy in
    the thermal neutron energy range so the coherent scattering length
    $\sigma_c$ is unchanged. The absorption cross section $\sigma_a$ for
    these elements scales linearly with wavelength and can be adjusted
    with a simple multiplication:

    .. math::

        \sigma_a' = \sigma_a \lambda' / \lambda_o = \sigma_a \lambda' / 1.798

    The incoherent scattering length is more complicated, including
    contributions from spin incoherence for different possible spin states
    as well as isotope incoherence from diffuse coherent
    scattering.\ [#Glinka2011]_ Using the total cross section $\sigma_s$ from
    the table, the incoherent scattering length is estimated as:

    .. math::

        \sigma_s &= \left.\sum n_k \sigma_{sk} \right/ \sum n_k \\
        \sigma_i &= \sigma_s - \sigma_c \\
        b_i &= \sqrt{ 100 \sigma_i / (4 \pi) }

    For the energy dependent rare earth isotopes the total scattering is
    estimated from $b = \mathrm{Re}(b_c) + i \mathrm{Im}(b_c)$, ignoring
    any spin incoherence effects. As a result, incoherent scattering for
    materials with energy-dependent rare earth isotopes with non-zero
    nuclear spin will be underestimated.

    The scattering potential can be expressed as a scattering length
    density (SLD).  This is the number density of the scatterers
    (per $\AA^3$) times their scattering lengths, scaled to
    $10^6/\AA^2$ (with $1/\AA^2$ = $10^{5} \mathrm{fm}/\AA^3$).
    Following the convention of Sears (1992), we define sld as
    $\rho = \rho_{\rm re} - i \rho_{\rm im}$.

    .. math::

        \rho_{\rm re} (10^6 / \AA^2) &= 10 N \mathrm{Re}(b_c) \\
        \rho_{\rm im} (10^6 / \AA^2) &= -10 N \mathrm{Im}(b_c) \\
        \rho_{\rm inc} (10^6 / \AA^2) &= 10 N b_i

    Similarly, the macroscopic scattering cross section for the sample includes
    number density:

    .. math::

        \Sigma_{\rm coh} (1/{\rm cm}) &= N \sigma_c \\
        \Sigma_{\rm inc} (1/{\rm cm}) &= N \sigma_i \\
        \Sigma_{\rm abs} (1/{\rm cm}) &= N \sigma_a \\
        \Sigma_{\rm s} (1/{\rm cm}) &= N \sigma_s

    The 1/e penetration depth $t_u$ represents the the depth into the sample
    at which the unscattered intensity is reduced by a factor of $e$:

    .. math::

        t_u (cm) = \left. 1 \right/ (\Sigma_{\rm s} + \Sigma_{\rm abs})

    The calculated penetration depth includes the effects of both
    absorption and incoherent scattering (which spreads the beam over the
    full $4\pi$ spherical surface, and so it looks like absorption with
    respect to the beam), as well as the coherent scattering from the sample.
    If you instead want to calculate the effective shielding of the sample,
    you should recalculate penetration depth with absorption only.

    Transmission rate can be computed from $e^{-d/t_u}$ for penetration
    depth $t_u$ and sample thickness $d$. This does not include many
    real world effects, such as single phonon scattering\ [#Mildner1998]_
    and forward scattering\ [#May1982]_, which result in measured
    transmission significantly different from the values predicted from
    nuclear properties alone.

    There is also a wavelength dependence for single phonon interactions which
    gives rise to significant inelastic scattering for lighter isotopes (H, D)
    and/or longer wavelengths (above 5 |Ang|). This factor is both
    temperature and material dependent and will not be included
    in the scattering calculations. In particular, penetration length and
    transmitted flux are going to be significantly overestimated.

    Including unit conversion with $\mu=10^{-6}$ the full scattering equations
    are:

    .. math::

        \rho_{\rm re}\,(\mu/\AA^2) &= (N/\AA^3)
            \, (\mathrm{Re}(b_c)\,{\rm fm})
            \, (10^{-5} \AA/{\rm\,fm})
            \, (10^6\,\mu) \\
        \rho_{\rm im}\,(\mu/\AA^2) &= (N/\AA^3)

            \, (10^{-5} \AA/{\rm\,fm})

        \rho_{\rm inc}\,(\mu/\AA^2) &= (N/\AA^3)
