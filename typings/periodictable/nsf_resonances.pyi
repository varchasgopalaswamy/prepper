        *isotope* is the isotope of interest (e.g., Sm[149])

        *E0* is the chosen pivot energy of the fit $E_0$ (eV)

        *E_lambda* is the formal compound nucleus energy level $E_\lambda$ (eV).

        *gamma_lambda_sq* is the reduced neutron width amplitude
        $\gamma_{\lambda(n)}$ (eV).

        *a* is the atomic radius, estimated as $1.16 A^{1/3} + 0.6$ fm if
        not provided, where $A$ is the atomic mass of the isotope.

        *Gamma_lambda* is the absorption width $\Gamma_{\lambda(a)}$ (eV).

        *Delta_E* is the level shift $\Delta_E$ (eV) that can "usually be
        neglected at the very low neutron energies considered in this paper".

        *A*, *B*, *C* are the fitted real + imaginary constants for the isotope,
        with units 1/eV for B and 1/eV^2 for C.
