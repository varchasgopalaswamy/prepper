This module has one class and nine fuctions.

   :class:`Xray`
       X-ray scattering properties for the elements.

The following attributes are added to each element:

   :func:`Xray.sftable`
       Three column table of energy vs. scattering factors f1, f2.

   :func:`Xray.scattering_factors`
       Returns f1, f2, the X-ray scattering factors for the given wavelengths
       interpolated from sftable.

   :func:`Xray.f0`
       Returns f0 for the given vector Q, with Q[i] in $[0, 24\pi]$ |1/Ang|.

   :func:`Xray.sld`
       Returns scattering length density (*real*, *imaginary*) for the
       given wavelengths or energies.

The following functions are available for X-ray scatting information processing:

     :func:`xray_wavelength`
         Finds X-ray wavelength in angstroms given energy in keV.

     :func:`xray_energy`
         Finds X-ray energy in keV given wavelength in angstroms.

     :func:`init`
         Initializes a periodic table with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
         Center for X-Ray Optics xray scattering factors.

     :func:`init_spectral_lines`
         Sets the K_alpha and K_beta1 wavelengths for select elements.

     :func:`sld_table`
         Prints the xray SLD table for the given wavelength.

     :func:`xray_sld`
         Computes xray scattering length densities for molecules.

     :func:`index_of_refraction`
         Express xray scattering length density as an index of refraction

     :func:`mirror_reflectivity`
         X-ray reflectivity from a mirror made of a single compound.

     :func:`xray_sld_from_atoms`
         The underlying scattering length density calculator. This works with
         a dictionary of atoms and quantities directly.

     :func:`emission_table`
         Prints a table of emission lines.

K_alpha, K_beta1 (|Ang|):
    X-ray emission lines for elements beyond neon, with
    $K_\alpha = (2 K_{\alpha 1} + K_{\alpha 2})/3$.

X-ray scattering factors:
    Low-Energy X-ray Interaction Coefficients: Photoabsorption, scattering
    and reflection for E in 30 to 30,000 eV, and Z in 1 to 92.

.. Note::

    For :ref:`custom tables <custom-table>`, use :func:`init` and
    :func:`init_spectral_lines` to set the data.


Emission line tables
====================

Data for the $K_\alpha$ and $K_\beta$ lines comes from
[#Deslattes2003], with the full tables available at
`<http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/xraytrans/index.cfm>`_.
Experimental Values are used, truncated to 4 digits
of precision to correspond to the values for the subset
of elements previously defined in the periodictable package.

X-ray f1 and f2 tables
======================
The data for the tables is stored in the ``periodictable/xsf``.
directory.  The following information is from ``periodictable/xsf/read.me``,
with minor formatting changes:

  These ``[*.nff]`` files were used to generate the tables published in
  reference [#Henke1993]_. The files contain three columns of data:

    Energy(eV), *f_1*, *f_2*,

  where *f_1* and *f_2* are the atomic (forward) scattering factors.
  There are 500+ points on a uniform logarithmic mesh with points
  added 0.1 eV above and below "sharp" absorption edges. The
  tabulated values of *f_1* contain a relativistic, energy
  independent, correction given by:

  .. math::

    Z^* = Z - (Z/82.5)^{2.37}

  .. Note::
    Below 29 eV *f_1* is set equal to -9999.

  The atomic photoabsorption cross section, $\mu_a$, may be readily
  obtained from the values of $f_2$ using the relation:

  .. math::

    \mu_a = 2 r_e \lambda f_2

  where $r_e$ is the classical electron radius, and $\lambda$ is
  the wavelength. The index of refraction for a material with *N* atoms per
  unit volume is calculated by:

  .. math::

    n = 1 - N r_e \lambda^2 (f_1 + i f_2)/(2 \pi).

  These (semi-empirical) atomic scattering factors are based upon
  photoabsorption measurements of elements in their elemental state.
  The basic assumption is that condensed matter may be modeled as a
  collection of non-interacting atoms.  This assumption is in general
  a good one for energies sufficiently far from absorption thresholds.
  In the threshold regions, the specific chemical state is important
  and direct experimental measurements must be made.

  These tables are based on a compilation of the available experimental
  measurements and theoretical calculations.  For many elements there is
  little or no published data and in such cases it was necessary to
  rely on theoretical calculations and interpolations across Z.
  In order to improve the accuracy in the future considerably more
  experimental measurements are needed.

  Note that the following elements have been updated since the
  publication of Ref. [#Henke1993]_ in July 1993. Check
  `<http://henke.lbl.gov/optical_constants/update.html>`_ for more
  recent updates.
