Adds average mass for the elements:

*    mass, mass_units (u)
         The molar mass averaged over natural isotope abundance.

Adds mass and abundance information for isotopes:

*    mass, mass_units (u)
         The molar mass of the individual isotope.

*    abundance, abundance_units (%)
         Natural abundance for the isotope.

Atomic Weights and Isotopic Composition [#Coursey]_.

The atomic weights are available for elements 1 through 112, 114, & 116 and
isotopic compositions or abundances are given when appropriate. The atomic
weights data were published by Coplen [#Coplen]_ in Atomic Weights of the
Elements 1999, (and include changes reported from the 2001 review in
Chem. Int., 23, 179 (2001)) and the isotopic compositions data were
published by Rosman [#Rosman]_ and Taylor [#Taylor]_ in Isotopic Compositions
of the Elements 1997.  The relative atomic masses of the isotopes data were
published by Audi [#Audi]_ and Wapstra [#Wapstra]_ in the 1995 Update To The
Atomic Mass Evaluation.

This data has been compiled from the above sources for the user's convenience
and does not represent a critical evaluation by the NIST Physics Laboratory.
